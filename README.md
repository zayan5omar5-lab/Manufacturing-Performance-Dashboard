Global Manufacturing & Sales Performance Analytics 📊
📊 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Power BI solution that transforms raw data from the "Power BI Case Study" into an interactive 5-page dashboard. It provides deep insights into sales performance, product profitability, and manufacturing efficiency, helping stakeholders bridge the gap between financial results and operational health.

🚀 Business Impact & Key KPIs
Total Revenue: $24.91M with a $10M Total Profit.

Profitability: Maintained a strong 41.97% Profit Margin.

Customer Value: Average Order Value (AOV) stands at $990.

Global Reach: Australia is the leading market with $7.4M in sales.

Operational Efficiency: Achieved an OEE of 79.82%, with identified bottlenecks in Material Shortages (120 hours lost).

Loss Prevention: Identified $765K in revenue leakage due to returns, primarily in the Mountain-200 product line.

🛠️ Technical Workflow & Skills
1. Data Integration & Cleaning
Processed the Power BI Case Study raw data using Power Query.

Handled missing values and ensured consistency across Sales, Production, and Return datasets.

2. Data Modeling
Built a robust Star Schema to optimize performance.

Connected Fact tables (Sales & Production) with Dimension tables (Products, Customers, Geography, and Calendar).

3. Advanced DAX Analysis
Developed custom measures to calculate OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness).

Implemented Time-Intelligence functions for Monthly Trend Analysis.

Created complex KPIs for Return Rates and Category Profitability.
