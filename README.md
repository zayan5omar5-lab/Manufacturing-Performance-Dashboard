Global Manufacturing & Sales Analytics Dashboard 📊
Project Overview
This is my first professional Power BI project, where I transformed complex manufacturing and sales datasets into a strategic, interactive dashboard. The project focuses on bridging the gap between financial results and operational efficiency to drive data-driven decision-making.

Key Features & Insights
Executive Summary: A high-level narrative connecting financial KPIs with production challenges.

Financial Performance: Analyzed $24.91M in total revenue and $10M in profit with a 41.97% margin.

Operational Efficiency: Tracked a 79.82% Machine OEE and identified Material Shortage as the primary cause for 120 lost production hours.

Product Analysis: Discovered that Bikes contribute 94.89% of revenue, while the Mountain-200 model is the main driver of returns.

Geographic Trends: Identified Australia as the market leader and highlighted growth opportunities in Europe.

Tech Stack & Skills
Data Modeling: Implemented a Star Schema for optimized performance.

DAX: Developed custom measures for Profitability, Return Rates, and Machine Efficiency.

Data Visualization: Designed a user-centric UI with a custom navigation bar and consistent branding.

Storytelling: Used the Smart Narrative approach to explain the "Why" behind the numbers.

Challenges & Learning
Being my first project, I faced several challenges:

Data Integration: Learning how to relate production downtime with sales performance.

User Experience: Designing a navigation system that feels like a modern web application. I am committed to continuous improvement and look forward to refining these skills in future projects.
